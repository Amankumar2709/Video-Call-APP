# Video-Call-APP
Built a fully responsive real-time video calling web application using React.js, ZEGOCLOUD Web SDK, and Netlify for seamless deployment.

Integrated ZEGOCLOUD to enable 1:1 video calling, user room authentication, and low-latency streaming.

Implemented client-side routing using React Router and SPA-friendly navigation with Netlify _redirects.

Designed and developed a clean, responsive UI using custom CSS and inline styling, enhancing user interaction and mobile experience.

Added user input validation, dynamic routing (/video/:name), and loading state for smoother UX.

Hosted and deployed the project on Netlify, ensuring continuous deployment and quick access through a public URL.

Followed best practices in React component structure and managed state effectively using useState and useNavigate.
